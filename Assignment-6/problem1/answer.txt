Part b: Comment on the ipcs Output
-----------------------------------
Before running the programs, the ipcs -m command shows the current shared memory segments. 
After running printLine and changeLine, new shared memory segments are visible.

Part c: Which Program to Run First and Why?
-------------------------------------------
Run printLine first because it waits for input. changeLine writes to the shared memory.

Part d: Observations After Running printLine
--------------------------------------------
printLine attaches to the shared memory and waits for a character to be available.

Part e: Observations After Running changeLine
---------------------------------------------
After running changeLine, printLine displays the written character. Monitoring ipcs confirms the shared memory usage.
